# Final Solution and Conclusion

In our project, we analyzed greenhouse gas emissions data from 2016 and 2017 to predict whether countries are on track to meet their emissions reduction targets. We focused on key factors such as population and GDP, which are significant drivers of emissions.
We employed various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Clustering, to predict total emissions and identify patterns in the data based on these factors. Our models were developed using Python, with data preprocessing steps that included data cleaning, handling missing values with median imputation, and feature scaling using StandardScaler.

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression was used to understand the relationship between total emissions and population. The model showed a positive correlation, indicating that as the population increases, total emissions tend to increase.

## Multiple Regression

Multiple Regression incorporated both population and GDP as predictors. This model aimed to capture the combined effect of population size and economic activity on emissions. The regression coefficients indicated that both factors positively contribute to emissions levels.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression was explored to account for any nonlinear relationships between population and emissions. The model provided a better fit than the linear model, suggesting that the relationship between population and emissions is not strictly linear.

## Clustering
Clustering was utilized to group countries with similar characteristics based on emissions, population, GDP, and average annual temperature. However, due to the lack of data on specific emissions reduction targets for each country, it was challenging to assess whether specific clusters were on track to meet their goals. The clustering analysis provided limited insights into emissions progress.

## Critical Evaluation

Despite our efforts, the project faced significant limitations that hindered our ability to accurately predict whether countries are on track to meet their emissions reduction targets.

* **Lack of Emissions Reduction Target Data:** A major limitation was the absence of data on the specific emissions reduction targets for each country. Without this crucial information, we could not directly assess progress against targets, rendering our predictions less meaningful in the context of meeting climate goals.

* **Data Limitations:** The dataset was restricted to two years (2016 and 2017), which is insufficient for capturing long-term trends or recent policy changes. Additionally, reliance on imputation for missing values may have introduced biases, affecting the reliability of our models.

* **Model Limitations:** The predictive power of our models was limited, as evidenced by modest R-squared values. This suggests that population and GDP alone do not fully explain the variability in emissions across different countries. Other influential factors, such as energy sources, industrial activities, environmental policies, and technological advancements, were not included in our models.

## Argumentation of Choices

We made several strategic choices throughout the project:

* **Selection of Machine Learning Models:** We began with Linear Regression due to its simplicity and ability to provide a baseline understanding of the relationship between population and emissions. Recognizing that emissions are influenced by multiple factors, we expanded to Multiple Regression to include GDP, capturing economic activity's impact. Polynomial Regression was selected to explore potential nonlinear relationships that linear models might overlook. Clustering was incorporated to identify patterns and group countrys with similar characteristics, potentially revealing insights not evident through regression alone.

* **Data Preprocessing Techniques:** To handle missing values, we opted for median imputation, which is robust against outliers and preserves the data's central tendency. Feature scaling using StandardScaler was essential to ensure that variables with larger scales did not disproportionately influence the model outcomes, promoting fair weight distribution among features.

* **Focus on Population and GDP:** These variables were chosen due to their widely recognized influence on emissions and their availability in our dataset. With limited data, concentrating on these key factors allowed us to maximize the insights drawn from the information at hand.

## Code

**Data Collection and Cleaning:** Scripts import the raw datasets and perform initial cleaning steps, including handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.

**Data Analysis:** Jupyter Notebooks contain visualizations such as scatter plots, correlation matrices, and A Box and Whisker to uncover relationships and trends in the data.

**Model Implementation:**

* **Linear Regression:** Implements a simple linear model between population and emissions.
* **Multiple Regression:** Extends the linear model to include GDP as an additional predictor.
* **Polynomial Regression:** Applies polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships.
* **Clustering:** Uses K-Means clustering to group countries based on selected features.
* **Streamlit Application:** An interactive web app allows users to explore the models, adjust parameters, and input custom data for real-time predictions and visualizations.

## Outcomes

The project gave important insights:

**Understanding of Emission Drivers:** Confirmed that both population and GDP positively correlate with greenhouse gas emissions, reinforcing existing theories about emissions drivers.

**Model Performance Assessment:** Identified limitations in the predictive capabilities of basic regression models when relying solely on population and GDP, as indicated by low R-squared values.

**Data Requirement Recognition:** Highlighted the necessity for more comprehensive and detailed data, and additional variables, to improve prediction accuracy.

## Final Conclusion

Our analysis indicates that while population and GDP are significant factors influencing greenhouse gas emissions, they are insufficient on their own to predict whether countrys will meet their emissions reduction targets. The lack of critical data on emissions targets and other influential variables limited the effectiveness of our models.
This project underscores the complexity of predicting emissions progress and highlights the importance of comprehensive data collection. Without access to specific emissions reduction targets and additional variables that impact emissions, such as policy measures and technological innovations, our ability to make accurate predictions remains constrained.
In conclusion, although we applied established statistical techniques and conducted a thorough analysis, our project demonstrates that predicting emissions progress is complex and cannot rely solely on population and GDP. A more comprehensive approach that incorporates additional variables and addresses data limitations is necessary for more accurate predictions.
