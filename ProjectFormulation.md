# Predicting Emissions Progress: Leveraging Data to Forecast Geographical Climate Target Success

## Project Formulation

### Context

Climate change and its associated risks are pressing global issues, with key environmental factors such as population size and economic activity (GDP) playing a critical role in influencing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments worldwide have set ambitious reduction targets to combat climate change, and various countries are tracking their progress towards these goals.

### Purpose

The main purpose is to analyze emissions data from 2016 and 2017 to assess the progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using various machine learning models, the goal is to predict emissions differences and determine if countries, based on factors like population and GDP, are on track to meet their reduction targets

**Challenge to Address:**

The challenge is to predict whether countries will achieve their emissions reduction targets by analyzing trends in CO2 emissions between 2016 and 2017, taking into account the influence of factors such as population growth and economic activity.

**Importance of Research:**

This research is important because understanding the impact of population and economic factors on emissions progress helps address climate change, which is one of the most pressing global challenges today

**Expected Solution:**

The project aims to offer a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of countries reaching their emissions reduction goals, using historical emissions data, population, and GDP as key predictors

**Positive Impact & Beneficiaries:**

The solution could help:
* **Policymakers** by providing actionable insights to adjust policies and meet environmental goals.
* **Environmental organization**s by identifying countries that require additional resources and support to meet their emissions reduction goals.
* **Urban planners** by offering data-driven insights into sustainable development and infrastructure planning based on key factors like population and economic activity.
* **Future of society** by contributing to a more sustainable  future, helping reduce the impact of climate change for future generations.

## Development Environment

**Team:**
* Sumaia El-Kalache
* Mounir Salem

**Project execution plan:**

Our plan is to meet twice a week after school, during our BI classes, to discuss and share our progress with each other. Each team member is free to dedicate as many hours as they wish, as long as they meet the agreed upon goals from our BI class discussions. Additionally, we stay connected on Discord for ongoing discussions and virtual meetings when needed.

**Tools:**

Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook – For coding and data analysis

Discord – For team communication and collaboration

GitHub – For code sharing, version control, and project management
