# Project Formulation

## Which challenge would you like to address?

The challenge is to analyze how global cities are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in line with their climate goals. The challenge also includes understanding whether these goals are realistic and how cities assess and handle their climate risks.

## Why is it an important or interesting research goal?

This is important because cities are responsible for a significant portion of the world's CO2 emissions, and their actions have a substantial impact on climate change. Analyzing their efforts can provide insights into which strategies are most effective and which cities are leading the way in climate actions. Additionally, air quality is directly related to public health, and reducing pollution will have a significant positive impact on peopleâ€™s well being.
