# Forecasting Climate Success: Analyzing Emissions and Reduction Targets

## Project Formulation

### Context

Climate change and its associated risks are pressing global issues, with cities playing a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments worldwide have set ambitious reduction targets to combat climate change, and many cities are now tracking their progress towards these goals.

### Purpose

The main purpose is to analyze emissions data from cities between 2016 and 2017 to assess progress towards their greenhouse gas reduction targets. Using various machine learning models, the goal is to predict emissions differences and determine if cities are on track to meet their goals.

**Challenge to Address:**

The challenge is to predict whether cities will achieve their emissions reduction targets by analyzing differences in CO2 emissions between 2016 and 2017 and exploring trends over time.

**Importance of Research:**

This is important because understanding the progress of cities in reducing emissions helps address climate change, one of the most pressing global issues today.

**Expected Solution:**

The project aims to offer a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of cities reaching their emissions reduction goals based on historical data and key environmental factors

**Positive Impact & Beneficiaries:**

The solution could help:
* Policymakers by providing actionable insights to adjust policies and meet environmental goals.
* Environmental organizations by highlighting cities that need support and resources for further emissions reductions.
* Urban planners by offering data-driven approaches to sustainable city development and infrastructure planning.
* Future of society by contributing to a more sustainable  future, helping reduce the impact of climate change for future generations.

## Development environment

**Team:**
* Sumaia El-Kalache
* Mounir Salem

**Project execution plan:**

Our plan is to meet twice a week after school, during our BI classes, to discuss and share our progress with each other. Each team member is free to dedicate as many hours as they wish, as long as they meet the agreed upon goals from our BI class discussions. Additionally, we stay connected on Discord for ongoing discussions and virtual meetings when needed.

**Tools:**

Anaconda – For coding and data analysis

Discord – For team communication and collaboration

GitHub – For code sharing, version control, and project management
