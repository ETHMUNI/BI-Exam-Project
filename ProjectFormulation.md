* Helps city governments, environmental orgs, and policymakers.
* Supports better decision-making for climate strategies.
* Useful for researchers and activists promoting climate policies.
* Improves air quality and reduces climate risks for city inhabitants.

## Which challenge would you like to address?

The challenge is to analyze how global cities are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in line with their climate goals. The challenge also includes understanding whether these goals are realistic and how cities assess and handle their climate risks.

## Why is it an important or interesting research goal?

This is important because cities are responsible for a significant portion of the world's CO2 emissions, and their actions have a substantial impact on climate change. Analyzing their efforts can provide insights into which strategies are most effective and which cities are leading the way in climate actions. Additionally, air quality is directly related to public health, and reducing pollution will have a significant positive impact on people’s well being.

## What is the expected solution your project would provide?

The expected solution is an in-depth analysis of cities’ emissions targets and air quality. The project can identify cities that are on track to meet their climate goals and those that are not, along with providing recommendations on how they can improve their efforts. It could also include a comparison between cities’ emissions reduction efforts and their current air quality, offering insight into whether the actions taken have had a measurable effect.

## What would be the positive impact of the solution, and which category of users could benefit from it?

The solution will have a positive impact on city governments, environmental organizations, and policymakers by helping them understand which measures are most effective in achieving climate goals. The data analysis could also be useful for researchers and activists advocating for better climate policies. On a broader scale, the inhabitants of these cities will benefit from improved air quality and reduced climate risks.
